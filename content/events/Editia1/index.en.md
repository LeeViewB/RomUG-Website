## RomUG - edition 1, September 2023

### Are you an IT Admin working with Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager, and other services and apps from Microsoft?
:loudspeaker: Then make sure you don't miss the first RomUG (Romanian User Group) event!

The event stands out as a unique opportunity to network with other IT specialists, where you can share experiences and discover updates related to Configuration Manager, Microsoft 365, Defender, and other similar applications.

We are at the start of our journey in Romania - there is plenty of room for flexibility when it comes to the structure of our event. Therefore, each edition will bring innovative elements tailored to the community. Whether you are interested in expanding your network, receiving advice, or staying up to date with the latest developments in the field, RomUG will be the right place for all of these.
